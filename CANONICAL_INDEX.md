# Canonical Index — ProofBundles

This document records observed artifact lineage, seal points, and continuity for the ProofBundles corpus. It makes no normative or enforcement claims.

## Verification Envelope
Inspected sources: Google Drive threads, GitHub/FalseAlias/proofbundles main (dea52a06)[cite:8], local corpus
As-of timestamp: 2026-01-31
Known exclusions: Uninspected external repos/formats
Falsification conditions: SHA mismatch on listed commits, pre-Nov22 artifacts

## Purpose
This index enumerates how existing artifacts relate across time, formats, and batching events. It does not supersede cryptographic manifests, specifications, or external verification.

## Observed Artifact Chain
The following sequence reflects preserved artifacts and their temporal ordering:

- **2025-11-22** — Pre-ProofBundles conceptual work (constraint, transformation, algebraic, and architectural primitives). Exemplar: initial constraint notes (hash pending Drive).
- **2025-12-03 → 2025-12-04** — First materialized core texts (Codex, Monolith, Algebra, Generator, Coherence). Exemplar: Codex v1 (hash pending).
- **2025-12-05 → 2025-12-07** — Method and whitepaper material appears; ProofBundles naming emerges.
- **2025-12-27** — Consolidation and structuring artifacts (brainstorm and kernel formalization).
- **2025-12-28 → 2025-12-29** — Claims articulation and initial batching / reduction passes.
- **2026-01-07** — PREOPUS packetization and batched concatenation (batching without semantic rewrite).
- **2026-01-12** — SHA256 manifest generated and self-hashed, referencing prior material without modification.
- **2026-01-13 → 2026-01-27** — Subsequent artifacts extending the corpus (core, spec, harness, patent consolidation).

No discontinuities or retroactive rewrites were observed within this inspected sequence as-of 2026-01-31.

## Seal Observation
Artifacts dated on or before **2026-01-12** are referenced by the SHA256 manifest generated on that date. Artifacts dated after **2026-01-12** appear as forward continuations and do not modify earlier material.

## Artifact Classification
- Some artifacts are structured as specifications, harnesses, manifests, or consolidated texts.
- Other artifacts (including concatenations, batching outputs, and PREOPUS packets) appear to function as evidentiary or transitional material.
- This index does not designate canonical authority; it records relationships as observed in inspected set.

## Non-Mutation Note
No evidence was observed of rewriting, regeneration, or replacement of artifacts dated prior to 2026-01-12 in the inspected corpus.
